This directory should contain 3 files for each database.
We have decided to keep the previous two megablast database
files, in case people need them later. So these are the 
originally downloaded gzipped fasta files (before any 
modifications) for the currently available ones and the 
previous two, for each database. The naming convention 
used is <dbname>_<filedatestamp>_<dowloadeddate>.gz, like
htgs_02jul2011_09jul2011.gz. We downloaded the htgs.gz 
file on July 9, and it was datestamped July 2.
